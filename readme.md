## Prerequisites:
* Linux
* Python 2.7
* Numpy 1.14.0
* OpenCV 3.4.0.12
* Keras 2.1.5
* Tensorflow 1.3.0
* Tflearn 0.3.2

## It was tested and runs under the following OSs:
* Ubuntu 18.04 


We also worked on Windows 10 using the Linux Subsystem through Developer Tools.
Might work under others, but didn't get to test any other OSs just yet.

## Getting Started:
### Installation

In short,
- Install python libraries and requests.
```bash
pip install -r requirement_1.txt
sudo apt install python-pycurl
pip install -r requirement_2.txt
```
Use the software manual for full configuration steps.

### Testing 
- To test the model:
```bash
python dehaze_run.py
``` 
The test results will be saved in: `./TestOutput/.`
